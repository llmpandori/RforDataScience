```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Process
cleaning --> wrangling --> descriptive stats --> modeling --> reporting
(non-linear process, course focuses on first 3 steps)

### Breakout session talk
Some folks have MCRS class experience, others brutalist approach
Need practice -- using R consistently
Data vis -- intuitive plots
Manipulation -- hard to see, can't do in E*cel for large datasets

### Outcomes
Confidence
Build resource bank -- Canvas page

### What is Tidyverse?
Set of 20 packages, all use same data format (dev by Hadley Wickam)
Import (readr)
Tidy
  Transform (dplyr, broom, XX?)
  Visualize (ggplot2, ggmap)
  Model (linear models)
Communicate 
  Markdown (repeatable science)
  
What is tidy data?
  1. Each var forms a column
  2. Each obs forms a row
  3. Each type of obs unit (value) forms a table

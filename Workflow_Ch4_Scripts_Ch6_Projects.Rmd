## Script editor : RStudio
See online text for more info (already familiar w RStudio and company)

## Projects
Never save workspace upon exit -- everything live should be saved as scripts/markdown files

Use project to avoid having to set wd

Have distinct project for each da project
  Keep all files w/in wd folder
  Save outputs there
  Only use relative paths -- not absolute
